Drain on paper towels; keep warm.On same griddle, heat remaining oil over medium heat. Break eggs, one at a time, onto griddle. Reduce heat; cook until whites are set and yolks have begun to thicken. Flip eggs if desired; cook to desired doneness.To assemble, top each potato patty with an egg, salsa, bacon and sour cream mixture. If desired, sprinkle with green onions.
